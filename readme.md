##Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net/archives

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to submit to this repository.  Fork the project, create a folder with the format {YourName}-{YourLang} and begin working.

For example, if I wanted to start working on project Euler in F# I would create a folder "ReidEvans-FSharp".  If I then wanted to work on Erlang I'd create an additional folder "ReidEvans-Erlang"
